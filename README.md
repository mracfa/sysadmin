Sysadmin stuff  



I will upload here some scripts that helped me on some projects. Any doubts just contact me.

The number of the script matches the assumption's number and the Instructions' number as well. 


### Script:
1. test_conectivity.sh

## Assumptions:
1. You have netcat (nc) package installed and you are running linux or a linux emulator like cygwin

## Instructions:
1. Change the IP and ports you want to test but keep them separated by spaces and between double quotes.  
   Execute this script: sh test_conectivity.sh and you will get the results immediately.
